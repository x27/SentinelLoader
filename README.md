# SentinelLoader

During startup, the program patches the Uniden Sentinel program to support the OpenScanner firmware frequency range.

### Usage:

Copy **SentinelLoader.exe** to the Uniden Sentinel program directory (for example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Uniden\BCDx36HP Sentinel).

Launch Sentinel using the **SentinelLoader** program.

Now you can enter frequencies that are not supported by the official firmware.
